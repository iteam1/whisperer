# whisperer

Use the Claude Code CLI you're already running as a Copilot-style completion engine in VSCode. You drive, Claude fills in. No autonomous agent burning $6k while you sleep.

> Status: working — broker + extension + `/whisper`, all three effort levels end-to-end.

## Effort levels

| Effort | Scope | Surface |
|--------|-------|---------|
| `low` | a few lines | ghost text |
| `medium` | a whole block | ghost text |
| `high` | the whole file | diff → accept with ✓ / `Cmd+Enter` |

```
/whisper          # medium (default)
/whisper low
/whisper high
/whisper check    # is the broker talking to VSCode?
```

## How it works

```
/whisper  →  broker :2323  →  extension  →  ghost text / diff
```

- **broker** — tiny Bun HTTP server. Routes completions by workspace path, no focus-tracking nonsense.
- **extension** — registers with broker on startup, streams cursor position, renders the completion.
- **/whisper** — reads cursor context, infers a completion sized to effort, posts it back.

See [`docs/design.md`](./docs/design.md) for the full data flow.

## Each session

```bash
# 1. start the broker
bun run --cwd packages/broker dev

# 2. install the slash command into your current project
mkdir -p .claude/commands && cp assets/whisper.md .claude/commands/whisper.md
```

Then open the project in VSCode, click into a file, and `/whisper`.

> Restarted the broker? It forgets everything — reload the VSCode window so the extension re-registers.

## First time?

See [`GUIDELINE.md`](./GUIDELINE.md) for the one-time extension build + symlink install.
